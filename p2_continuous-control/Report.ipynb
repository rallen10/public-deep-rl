    "This work trains simulated robotic arms to track a dynamic target position for their end effector. The environment has a continuous state space, representing orientations and rates of arm joints, as well as a continuous action space, representing torques applied to arm joints. For training, this work uses [proximal policy optimization (PPO)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf) in an actor-critic form and a [generalized advantage estimate (GAE)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02438.pdf). Two deep neural networks are trained: one for the stochastic policy that maps the robots state to actions, and one for the value function that estimates the expected returns from a given state of the robot.
